style.mdc – Material Design Component theme for Recortes (attached to Claude 4 Sonnet)

Design Feeling:

* Modular & Collectible: Each fragment (recorte) feels like a unique, collectible card—organized yet playful.
* Vibrant & Inviting: Bright primary Vista Blue bursts with creative energy, balanced by warm Purpureus accents.
* Clean & Spacious: White and light surfaces give breathing room, highlighting each card and icon.
* Tactile Depth: Subtle shadows and smooth, rounded edges suggest physical cards you can interact with.
* Dynamic & Responsive: Gentle motion and consistent easing make interactions feel both lively and comforting.
